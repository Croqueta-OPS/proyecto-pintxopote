# rhc.npm

Why should anyone port OpenShift's `rhc` command-line tool from Ruby to javascript?  Well, I'm really not sure why actually...

Check in here if you're interested in hacking on a javascript port -> http://github.com/ryanj/rhc.npm/

Currently, this does nothing:

    npm install rhc

Try this instead:

    sudo gem install rhc
